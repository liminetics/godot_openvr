// This macro is used to define signals for each VREvent to make it impossible for the list of signals to get out of sync with
// the events. The name of the signal is automatically derived from the EVREventType. This would normally be impossible since
// there is no way to introspect the name of enum members. While IVRSystem provides GetEventTypeNameFromEnum, this would
// require connecting to OpenVR before creating our signals which makes the experience in the editor less than ideal.
